First,,you've got to put the victim on trial.,If your client didn't do it, then who did?,There have to be other people,with a motive,,which usually mean that the victim,,was not such a sterling character.,You have to keep pointing the,jury to the fact,that someone else could have done it.,It's up to you to develop a,counter-scenario,that is plausible.,And also don't refer to your,client as the defendant.,She has a name.,She is a person.,Use her name.,You want the jury to think of her that way.,Besides that, you left the,prosecution off the hook,up and down the line.,Other than that, you did a great,job though.,Serves Leyton right for,letting you on the jury.,You know what? If he hadn't the other jurors,might have wondered more about his case.,He was betting his cards were,strong enough.,If the cops had done a better job,,who knows, he might have won.,You never know.,Anybody ever tell you,,you can be really, seriously difficult?,Do you really mean that or is,it just your way,of suppressing pent up desires?,Guess.,I'll call you.,Sure.,I'd like to remind you that,Claire Harriman,,escaped conviction by one vote,,one vote out of twelve.,It is the intention of this department,to retry this case as soon as possible.,Because it is our firm belief,that another twelve fair-minded,people will vote for justice.,Excuse me Mr. Leyton...,- Thank you all.,when do you think this will be,retried sir.

I just think it's a,good idea,to remove the temptation where possible.,The court appreciates your concerns.,How is Wednesday the 26th?,- Fine. - Works for me.,Your Honor at this time also I'd,like to reopen the issue of bail.,This was settled before the first trial.,People versus McNamara,,the appeals court ruled that,extended incarceration due to a hung jury,and the People's desire for a retrial,,makes the question of bail appropriate.,Your Honor, my client has,pledged to put up her,few remaining assets in order to,gain her freedom so she can,help prepare her defense.,And you have my word she is not,a flight risk.,I'll reduce bail from five hundred thousand,to one hundred thousand.,Thank you Your Honor.,See you both on the 26th.,Mr. McBride, Mr. Leyton...,I just have one question...,Hi guys, listen I'm not going,to um, take any questions.,But I do have a brief statement.,As you may know,,I sat on the first jury trial of,Claire Harriman.,I thought at that time she was innocent.,So I not only voted for acquittal,,so I also offered her my,services to her as legal counsel.,Now I am allowed, under the,canon of ethics, to represent her.,What I know,about this case to date,is all a matter of public record.,And Mrs. Harriman is entitled to,have anyone she chooses,to represent her.,And I am pleased she selected me.,As I just want to see justice done.,That's all for today. Thank you.,Bye.,So much for trying the case in media.,Shhhh.,I'm just trying to level the playing field.,I think you've got a serious,thing for this woman,,or a professional death wish.,Oh come on. I'm feeling lucky.,How big a favor?,I'm disappointed.,You're always complaining about,my lack of romantic gestures.,I heard you took her case.,Damsel in distress sort of thing.,She's a little past her sell-by,date to qualify as a damsel.,Oh, oh come on.,Don't take this personally.,Anyway, I'm not here looking for a favor.,Maybe not.,But you will be.,You know what you're turning into a cynic.,Which doesn't become you.,Are you okay?,- McBride.,Now a hundred thousand dollars,bond means I need to put up,ten thousand dollars right?,- Right.,- And I don't have ten thousand dollars.,Not yet.,We got to get Wingy his ten,grand for bailing you out.,In here let me do the talking.,Let's see the box.,Help yourself.,I do believe that we can,raise what we need with this.,Anniversary present.,Must have been a very good year.,So why did you keep this in a,safety deposit box and not at home.,I was afraid that his charming,daughter Emily would steal it.,There was a couple of pieces,already missing.,Phyliss!,Your lucky day.,Well, look what the cat dragged in.,I don't know McBride. Most,people are just going,to think this is costume jewelry.,But you and I know that setting is antique.,You go to the Jewelry Mart,you'll get more than enough.,He's a smooth talker isn't he?,The smoothest.,How much?,I'll give you ten for the lot.,C'mon do your soul some good.,Twenty Five.,- Fifteen.,Twenty period. You know,Harry's parole hearing is next month.,You promise not to go and I'll,make it fifty.,Just give me the twenty.,Wait here.,So. Wingy got ten for your,bail.,Here is a thousand for you.,The rest goes for expenses.,You'll get an accounting.,Unless of course I lose.,in which case it won't matter.,You always this reassuring?,Now listen.,From now until the trial I want,you to stay put.,You don't talk to anybody about,anything except the weather.,And avoid the press at all cost.,Go to a movie if you get restless.,But keep yourself inconspicuous.,You've got my cell number if you need me.,Oh uh. Here's the homework,on the son, the daughter and the,executive secretary.,Good. Now can you think of,anybody else,,who'd want to go after him?,There were people who could do,without him but,,no real grudges or anything to gain.,What about Marta the maid?,I don't know much about her.,Any reason she would lie about seeing you?,I don't know. Maybe she saw,Emily or Elena.,Or somebody.,Okay.,Time to go to work.,Yes?,No. No. I'm not interested.,Telemarketers!,Ug. I hope they pass that law.,See ya.,Freeze.,Mmm.

What do you want?,- Well..,- On the Harriman case.,All right.,I want to see the interviews you,did with the family members.,You have got a lot of nerve.,It's the nicest thing said,you've said so far.,You know I can't let you look,at those files.,Roberta,,There is something wrong with this case.,You're too good not to have sensed it.,- No.,- I need your help.,No!,Please ma'am.

You could be a,cat.,You and I together? Yeah.,We'll be fine.,Need a hand?,Oh,Hi.,Sorry for not knocking.,Odd habit I have when I walk,into my own office.,Listen, I am sorry. But your,door was unlocked.,The super told me about your,break-in so I went out,,and got you this motion-detector.,I can be a little slow I know.,But last time I looked,you were a Public Defender.,I quit. This morning.,And there's more to this story.,Being a Public Defender is not,why I became a lawyer.,You've got this humongous case load,,no resources.,I mean witness the Harriman fiasco,you were absolutely right about my defense.,It was lame.,So, it got me to thinking.,I should do what you do.

,
,
,This was back in the day,when everyone was still straight.,And I was hyped.,And so, I was wearing,my purple button-down shirt,,and I was wearing,my GapKids khakis,,with the elastic around the waist,,for the kids who were like:,""I need to go poopy now!"",I was very excited,,particularly about this party,,because there was this girl there, Lizzy,,who I'd had a crush on,my entire childhood.,And she's sitting alone, watching TV.,And I walk in.,I already had my opening line,ready to go, I go:,""So did you hear Mrs. Goldman's daughter,might have cancer?"",Just spitting hot game.,

,And just as she looks over at me,,Jenny, the girl whose house it is,,comes up behind me,,and she pantses me.,Those GapKids khakis with,the elastic waist come right on down.,And then below that,I'm wearing silk boxer shorts.,Like a business man,on vacation in Hong Kong.,Those slide right on down...,Lizzy looks over at me,,and she is now eye to eye,with my bald little cashew.,She is horrified.,Jenny, the girl who pantsed me,,is mortified.,And I am now a comedian.,Thank you.,Thank you.,I was a late bloomer,,and that's why it was so terrible,getting pantsed at that age.,I was also a picky eater.,As a little kid I basically,would only eat mac and cheese.,And, uh, I remember,my mom would try to feed me other stuff,,I didn't want anything else...,Every once in a while,she could spice it up,with something like fettuccine Alfredo.,Which in reality was just creaming it up.,It was...,Fettuccine Alfredo,,the wettest of the pastas.,One night I just slurp up,a big old bowl of fettuccine Alfredo.,A great pre-karate meal.,Especially for an undiagnosed,six-year-old lactose-intolerant.,So I finish the fettuccine Alfredo.,Hop in the minivan.,I'm not trying to brag,,but we had the Plymouth Voyager.,It was not a big deal.,I get in the way, way back.,I'm in deep right, okay?,My mom gives me a peach for dessert.,And I'm just like:,""Ew, this peach is juicy!"",She's like: ""Well, then don't eat it."",And I just take it,and I just jam it into the cup holder.,Put a napkin over it, and I'm just like:,""Peach!"",Because at that point in my life,I did have a ""spees"" impediment.,We then arrive at karate.,I took karate. I was a little Jewish boy,,and I took karate with ten,Irish-Catholic firemen in my town.,At a Catholic school in my town,called Resurrection.,This was a school that I was not,welcome at during the day.,But I wanted to be like:,""Without me,,I don't know if you got the name?"",Allegedly, D.C.,So I roll into karate.,And I say hello,to my fellow martial artists.,You know, like, show them great respect.,I don't know if you have ever had,the privilege of attending a karate class,or even better, a karate demo.,Which is the occasional ceremony,where you show,that you can do a TikTok dance,very basically.,To be like... And I'm like...,I don't know. I'm sorry. I won't do it.,And you would slowly move up,from a white belt to a yellow belt,to a black belt.,And so I'm in karate,,and I'm doing all the kicks,and all the punches.,And I'm just like... ""Okay, I'm good."",""I'm good at karate."",And all of a sudden I hear like:,And I'm like: ""Oh, fettuccine Alfredo."",So I excuse myself from karate.,From all the martial artists.,And I,go into the hallway and then do that,,you know, that, like, speed walk you do,,when you're like, you know.,And it's so fun being,in another school's hallway.,You see, like, an inspirational poster.,You know, like Jesus that says, like:,""Hang in there."" And...,Oh... And I get to the bathroom,,and I'm getting ready to go.,And I've, like, knotted the gi.,Now, I don't know if you guys,are familiar again with the martial arts,,but a gi is the outfit,you wear for karate.,Now, ""ghee"" is also a word,that is now used for clarified butter.,For those of you who may,be familiar with the keto diet,or bulletproof coffee.,I'm currently doing bulletproof coffee,,and that is where you put,like, a lot of clarified butter,in your coffee.,Five years from now they're gonna be like:,""Remember when everyone's veins exploded?"",It was like the Atkins diet.,Remember the guy,who invented the Atkins diet,died of a heart attack?,Or the guy who invented the Segway?,Do you guys know how the guy,who invented the Segway died?,He fell off a cliff on his Segway...,Which is a good segue back to...,...my gi.,Which I had knotted like a hundred times,,because children,don't understand the future,or consequences.,So I'm trying to unknot the gi.,And then I just spray the gi...,...with fettuccine Alfredo foam.,I now have to go back,through the school hallway,kind of like moseying along.,Like a little John Wayne.,I get back into karate, and I'm like:,""Howdy, Kemosabe."",The firemen do not say a word.,But you know they went home,to their wives and were like:,""The fucking Kroll kid,shat his fucking gi."",So what I'm trying to tell you is:,I walked into karate that night,a white belt,,but I left a brown belt.,Thank you.,I really am a late bloomer.,It took me a while to do a lot of things.,Like the first time I said: ""I love you."",Does anyone here remember the first time,they said ""I love you"" to someone?,And not like, you know, a family member,or like a gorgeous plate of chicken parm.,Do you remember?,You can shout out how old your were,the first time you said,""I love you"" to someone.,Thirteen. Eighteen.,I was thirty-two.,Does anyone here remember the first time,they had their heart broken?,Thirteen. Sixteen.,I was thirty-three.,That means that the first woman,I said ""I love you"" to,was also the first woman,to break my heart.,And she fucking got me good!,This was like ten years ago.,Her name was Kate.,And she was like the kind of woman,that I'd always thought,I could never get.,She was beautiful and funny.,And smart.,She was the kind of girl that I always,had a crush on in high school.,But we were just friends, you know.,I don't know if that kind of dynamic,is familiar to people,who come to comedy shows.,But you know that thing,,where you're like...,You're friends,,and one person likes the other person.,And the tension just builds,,until someone's like:,""Jocelyn, can I speak to you tonight?"",""Boy, this is gonna end well."",Then I'd go to a party,and get kinda drunk and be like:,""Jocelyn, as I mentioned earlier today,,I wanted the opportunity,to speak with you,and let you know,that I value our friendship so much.,But I also need you to know,how often I jerk off to you."",And she'd be like:,""Oh, Nicky, that is so sweet.,But I think we're just better as friends."",And I'd be like: ""Yeah, that was,the outcome I was hoping for."",And then she would go outside,and give a hand job to a lacrosse player,with multiple concussions,at a party at my house.,Okay?,But now I'm 32,,and I've met this woman, Kate.,And we are in love.,We're talking about moving in together.,We're having those conversations you have,when you think you're with your person.,You know, you're like...,""Well, if we even had a kid..."",Like, you know.,""What would we even name it?"", you know?,And I was like: ""Kilometer.,Kilometer Kroll. It's a strong name."",Cause like, I'm a huge Miles Davis fan.,But I'm, like, an even bigger fan,of the metric system.,So we were really,,we were in it, and uh...,She gets a gig in New York,,and we have a wedding in New York,,and I fly to meet her at the wedding,,and then we're gonna have this,,like, really romantic weekend together.,And we go to the wedding.,I don't know if you've ever been to a,wedding with the person that you're dating,and you're watching the wedding,being like: ""Is this like what we'd...?"",""I mean, I guess this little,ring-bearer girl is cute,,but we would have like a dachshund,in a white tuxedo hold the rings, right?"",And I'm watching the vows,,and I'm just bawling.,And then I look over at her,,and she's crying a lot less.,We go home after the wedding,,and she's like:,""Nick, we have to talk."" And I'm like:,""About what? The future?"",And she's like: ""Sort of."",And I'm like: ""What's going on?"",She's like: ""I think we should break up."",And I'm like:,""What? What do you mean? We're great."",She's like:,""No, Nick. We've been talking about this."",And I'm like:,""We have not been talking about this!"",And she's like: ""Well, I've been,talking about it with my friends."",And when you're getting dumped,,you realize you are,the last person to find out,that you're getting broken up with.,This person has focus grouped all of this.,They have workshopped the material,,and now they are presenting you,with their findings.,Which is that you ain't shit, bitch.,So I'm like: ""Let's talk about this."",She's like: ""Nick, I've told you before.,I never wanna get married."",I was like:,""We don't have to get married!,We can be one of those couples,that's just like together,,and everyone's like:,'What's their fucking deal?,Do they not want insurance?"" Like...,So I just start, like, pleading.,I'm like: ""Please."",Which was not an effective method,,because I know that part of the reason,she wanted to break up with me is,that she didn't, like,,find me masculine enough.,She wanted a guy with sleeves of tattoos,who could drive stick,,who could ride a motorcycle...,And I'm just never gonna be the guy,who rides a motorcycle.,If I were, I'd be the guy,at the back of the pack, who's like:,""Oh no, I'm gonna miss the light.,Aww, I'm gonna get split up,from the fellas.,I was really looking forward to,rumbling through a neighborhood,and ruining people's day."",So when I'm like: ""Please..."".,It was not effective.,But I just kept poking. I was like:,""You need to give me a reason."",She's like:,""Nick, it doesn't... Nick, fine!,I'm just not attracted to you."",And I was like...,""Oh, cool. Cool...,Okay, cool. Very cool.,Very cool.

Like, I'm a crier. I cry...,But, like, I cry from happy stuff,,you know.,I cry giving toasts. You know, like...,And it's one of the things that Kate,did not like about me. I'd be like:,""Can we just quickly raise a glass?"",You know, and she'd be like:,""Ugh, fucking ride a motorcycle."",And I'm like: ""I can't, because even if,I am safe and I wear a helmet,,I can't trust the other drivers,on the road..."".,I cry watching Lowe's commercials,,you know.,You know those commercials,where the dad buys all the fixings,for a basketball hoop?,You know, like, the lumber,and the mashed potatoes.,All the fixings.,Then he puts it up in the driveway.,And he's teaching his ten-year-old son,,like, how to shoot free throws, you know.,And then you cut to ten years later,,and now that son is playing,in the national championship game.,And he's wearing a non-branded jersey,that says, like, ""State."",And the other team is like,""University of College."",And he gets fouled,,and there's one second left on the clock.,And now he's at the free throw line.,And he hits the winning free throw,,and the crowd goes wild.,And he looks up at his dad, and he's like:,""Thank you for building,this basketball hoop.,And thank you for shopping at Lowe's."",And the dad looks down at him,,and he's like:,""I love you,,and I love shopping at Lowe's.,And I love this man."",And he's now with an older black man,,and I'm like:,""Oh my God,,look at this modern American family!"",That'll make me cry.,Getting dumped got me good, man.,""I'm just not attracted to you."",But when Kate said that to me,,I was like: ""That is so... fair.,I'm a fucking gargoyle."" You know?,I mean, does anyone here look in the,mirror and feel good about what they see?,""Yeah!"" There's usually, like, one guy,and Lizzo.,You know...,And I get it with Lizzo. She plays,the flute.

I gotta go."",Meanwhile, dads are better at that.,You know, like, my dad, honestly,,I could call him, I don't hear back,from him for like three weeks,,and then I'll get a text at midnight,on a Wednesday, that's like:,""You up?"",And I'm like: ""I am for you, Daddy."",So I am in therapy...,Yeah.,I am, and I think one of the most,useful things I learned in therapy was,that you can't really fall in love, until,you can figure out how to love yourself.,And, it takes a really long time,to figure that out.,And, so, I finally met a woman.,Her name's Lily, and we...,We started going on dates,,and we just hit it off.,And we really fell in love.,And we went on our first, like,,really romantic holiday to Italy.,We went to the city of Bologna,,which in Italian means baloney.,And we're having a great time,,but I was like: ""I gotta step this up.,How do you fucking step this up?"",I was like: ""Let's go rent a car.,Let's go for a drive,through the Italian countryside."",She's like: ""Great."",So we go to the Hertz Bologna.,Which in Italian means:,""My pee-pee hurts."",You can't see me behind this stool.,So we go to the Hertz Bologna.,We pack up the car.,And, uh...,Car is stick.,And I'm like: ""Babe, cool thing about me?,Is, uh, I don't actually,really drive stick."",And she's like: ""Oh. Okay.,No problem. I'll just go tell the guy."",So she goes inside and gets,the Hertz Bologna rental-car guy.,And he comes out, and he's like:,""Hey, no way...,No way...,Eh, automatico...,...in Bologna, huh?,No automatico in Bologna."",And I'm like: ""Okay."",And he's like: ""You, eh...,You don't have, eh...,You don't have a stick?"" And I'm like:,""I have a stick,,I just don't know how to use it, okay?"",And he's like: ""Okay...,I got an idea. A lightbulb.,I got an idea. How about this?,You hire a driver. The driver, he sit,in the front seat with your girlfriend.,They, uh...,You sit in the back seat,,automatico, eh?,You cuckold, eh?,You cuckold snowflake, eh?"",And I'm like: ""Fuck you, man.,I can figure this out, okay?"",So I look at my girlfriend,,and I'm like:,""Babe, if you can be patient with me,,I can figure this out."" She's like:,""I got you."" So...,I don't know if you guys,have ever driven stick, but...,There's three pedals.,Including one called ""the clutch."",Which, you know, I'm a guy's guy.,So I know that a clutch,is a little pocketbook,that women take out for a fancy night.,So I ease off the clutch.,And I press down on the other thing.,And I put it into first, and I,just like can't, you know...,It's stalled.,Just cannot get it's gears grinding.,Just can't get it moving at all.,Kind of like,Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black.,Just like...,""Give me sugar!"",So the ten-minute ride,to get out of Bologna,takes about an hour and 45 minutes.,But then we get out of the city,,and now we're on the open road.,And it's so beautiful.,The sun is setting.,And all of a sudden,the hairs on my arms start to rise.,And I'm like: ""Oh no."",And Statham's like: ""Had to have,that second cappuccino, didn't you?,That diarrhea's coming fast and furious.,Hope you got a transporter,to ride to a loo."",And I'm like:,""Are you gonna list all of your movies?"",And he's like: ""The Meg."",And I'm like:,""Babe, we just gotta pull over,and go to a gassatoria real quick."",And she's like: ""Okay."" So I'm like:,""Ooh. This caterpillar wants,to become a butterfly."",We pull up to a gas station.,I have to downshift.,That's the hardest part.,Can't, you know, get it back into gear.,We're like 15 feet from the gas thing.,And I'm like: ""Oh god."",My girlfriend's like:,""Babe, are you okay?"" And I'm like:,""Yeah,,my stomach's just like a little off."",And she's like:,""Babe, it's okay if you have diarrhea.,You can tell me, because I love you."",And then I look at her.,And I shit my pants.,And that's when I knew she was the one.,So, that was like the end of 2019,,and we moved in together after that.,She moved in with me in Los Angeles,at the beginning of 2020.,And do you guys remember...,March 2020?,The lockdown starts, and now the two of us,are just living in this house together.,And I knew that she was,the women I wanted to marry,,that I wanna spend,the rest of my life with,,that I wanna have a family with.,But I don't know about you guys,,but even before COVID,everything felt real crackly, you know.,Everything just felt fucking off,,and then COVID happens.,And I'm like: ""Do I wanna have children?,Do I wanna bring a child into this world,,with everything going on?"",And I just got scared, you know?,And I know how hard it is to have a kid,without anything going wrong.,Like, I have all these nieces and nephews,,and all my friends have kids.,And there's nothing harder than,making a four-year-old eat dinner.,You know what I mean? You ever given,a four year old dinner?,""Here's some mac and cheese."",""I don't want that."" You know.,""What do you want?"" ""I want pizza."",""Okay.""

This is crazy!,-Then, why are you guys still here?,-What did you expect from us?,What do you want to do now?,Just so you know,,I was sitting next to Erlangga,before they killed him!,I'm probably next!,And you think I'm not?,Without Erlangga,,I won't continue the project.,I don't want any more victims.,Agni, wait up!,-Where's the car?,-Wait a minute.,-Quinn, where's the car?,-It's on that side.,Do you want to stop me too?,Calm down. Do not take their words.,Can't you stop talking about that?,Enough, Agni.

,
,
,
,And, if she is convicted,,she could face up to life in prison.,And so the most compelling thing,to me was,,""Are women able,to use the system to defend themselves,in the way that men are?"",I have two kids.,- There's my lovely brother.,- Brittany and Chris.,Say hi, Chris!,Their father and I divorced,when they were four and eight.,I was a single mom.,In Jackson County,,it's hard to be a single mom,because there's,not much financial assistance whatsoever,for a single mom.,I worked anywhere,from 12 to 16 hours a day,,sometimes more,if I could get more in, you know.,But we ended up living in the projects.,Brittany, she was smart as a whip.,I mean, that child,could pass a test, any test,,without ever even crackin' a book.,She was just really a honor roll student.,Brittany got married. I guess she was 19.,And then her husband left,and went back to his mom's.,They got back together,,they separated, they got back together.,I quit keeping up,because it was just like,,""Just let me know how many plates to set,"",you know, or...,She has four kids,,and she's had some hardships,being a single mom.,Trying to work,,trying to take care of the kids,,and then depression,,it really hit her hard.,When Brittany had Baby Will,,Baby Will had, uh, Potter's syndrome.,It... it's a genetic disorder.,He just lived 45 minutes.,When she lost a full-born child,,Brittany went out in left field,and found peace somewhere else,with addiction.,Oh, it's raining.,It's gotten really bad in Jackson County,,as a whole, with the drugs.,And it wasn't that way when I was a kid,,you know, growin' up.,When I noticed my daughter,started lookin' like a toothpick...,She started hanging out,with different people...,Can I take your order?,Do y'all want anything?,You good? Um...,I need two sausage,,egg, and cheese McGriddles.,- Thanks.,- Have a good day.,You too.,But, um, anyway, um,,it was just one hell of a ride.,I'm just gonna tell you.,I started using methamphetamine.,And then, just a few months in,,I lost my kids.,My world was gone.,When she lost child custody,,she hit rock bottom.,We did support and help her,as... as much as we could.,And she struggled.,She relapsed a couple of times.,But she pulled herself back up.,She did get clean, and she stayed clean.,And, I mean,,she was workin' at a home, doin' good.,And on January the 10th of 2018,,Brittany had a home evaluation done,on her home.,Made sure everything was safe,for the kids, and, um, she passed it.,The lady told her she was proud of her.,- Wow!,- Brittany was super excited.,We had waited so long,to get these kids back.,So you had a good time, huh?,Which one was your favorite animal to see?,The llama!,The llama? Did it try to spit on you?,Brittany was looking,to buy a puppy.,She wanted that puppy for the kids.,Todd Smith, he was a pit bull breeder.,She had met Todd,back in, like, high school days.,Brittany arranged with him to purchase,a pit bull puppy, which she did.,It was only just a couple of days later,that the shooting happened.,I get a call from Todd asking,if I would come and get him from the park,because his ride had dropped him off,,and they wouldn't come back and get him.,So I told him, you know,,""All right, we'll come and get you."",""You can stay on my couch for one night,,but tomorrow you have got to leave."",""You can't just hole up at my house.,It's not a crash house."",""I'm about to get my kids home."",And we talked for a little while.,And I wasn't trying to brag,,but I was like,,""You know, I'm working.,I'm about to get my children back."",""Things are looking forward for me."",And then...,...I don't know what happened.,Something snapped inside of this man.,And he jumped up,and started screaming at me.,And he headbutts me.,So I take off runnin' through the hallway,to my bedroom, and I slam the door.,And, um, he busted through the door,and tackled me on the bed,and started choking me.,And then I saw black, and I thought,,""This is what it's like to die.,God, please don't let me die."",And, uh, I woke up, and I peed on myself.,And my pants are off,,and he's raping me.,And he's still choking me.,And he says, ""If you say one F-ing word,,I will kill you."",He said, ""If you even breathe wrong,,I will kill you."",Brittany called, I guess, about 12:40.,And she said, um,,""Mama, will you bring me,a pack of cigarettes?"",And I said, um,,""Baby, I don't have any money,till Wednesday or Thursday,"" you know?,And, uh, she said, ""Mama, I've got money."",She said, ""Just... just get over here,and take me to the store."",'Cause we were down,to the one car, you know.,I was so tired.,I had worked that day.,It was freezing cold and snowin'.,My hair was wet, and I was like,,""Chris, can you just go take your sister,to the store to get some cigarettes?"",I'm a little bit irritated,because I'm tired.,But I... I get up,,and I head to Brittany's house.,I thought it was just gonna be,me and her going to the store.,But then Todd comes out behind Brittany,,and Brittany gets in the front seat.,Brittany was not talking as much,,but I didn't pay much attention.,I drive over into MAPCO.,While she's in the store,,me and Todd are talkin' in the car.,I was taking care of a customer,,and Brittany comes in.,She is, like, all out of sorts.,You could tell,she looked like she'd been in a fight.,And then I'm like, ""What happened to you?"",And then, as soon as I said that,,she was like, ""Shh."",You know, ""Don't draw any attention."",And that's when she started telling me,what happened to her.,That she was being held hostage,,that she had been raped,,beaten by Todd Smith.,And I was like,,""Just stay here. Like, get in this room."",And she said,,""I can't. My brother's in the car."",""If I don't go back out there,,he's gonna hurt my brother."",After a minute, she comes out,,and I go to pull off,to take them back home.,Todd gets out of the car first and starts,to walk upstairs to go in the house,,and Brittany, before she gets out,,she tells me that I need to go back,to the MAPCO to talk to one of the clerks.,He was clueless.,Like, he had no idea.,And I started tellin' him,,and he was like, ""What?"",So, I'm driving back,over to the house.,I always had my pistol right here,on my side.,I... I went in the back door,,and... and Todd's in the kitchen,,gettin' something to drink.,I told him that he needed,to get his stuff and leave.,He's just standing there, not movin'.,I just wanted Todd gone.,I put my gun on the counter,and try to physically remove him,from the house,,and then... then that's,when the fight started.,I run into the kitchen,,and they're fighting.,And Todd has my brother, choking him out.,I picked up the gun,,and I said, ""Todd, stop."",""I don't want to have to shoot anybody.,Please let my brother go."",And he wouldn't, so I fired the gun.,And nothing happened.,And so I shot again.,With the third time,,my brother and him fell down.,Jackson County 911.,Hi. I need an ambulance.,Someone just, um, got shot.,Where's the person,that shot him?,He's right here with me.,He's my brother.

No pulse. Okay.,You know, I was raised,to do the right thing,,even though the rest of the world,may not see it like that.,In Jackson County,,women don't get treated fairly in general.,So I thought, ""If I don't take the blame,,she's never gonna get her kids back."",The next morning, I woke up.,My heart sank.,I told Mom, ""I have to go turn myself in."",What you originally told us,,that your brother shot him.,Yes.,Now you're saying,it was actually you,that actually shot him.,I should a told the truth,from the beginning.,She never should have been took,to jail.

I got a law book.,I thought, ""Yes, this is her law,that's gonna get her out of this."",Wow.,- That's good news.,- Is that your cup?,Yep.,And we'll have the Stand Your Ground,,and then we're gonna ask,for those charges to be dismissed.,She had every right.,She was in her own home.,This is classic Stand Your Ground.,I think Brittany's story is very credible,,and we had the law on our side.,She's not engaged in an unlawful activity.,She's not the initial aggressor.,She's basically at the house.,The brother is being choked out by Todd.,Choke hold is deadly force.,She was justified in that.,I think we had,a strong Stand Your Ground case.,The DA got with Todd's family,,and they wanted me,to take a 25-year plea deal.,I told 'em,I'm not pleading out to anything. No.,Because I'm innocent,,and I will go to jail an innocent woman,before I'll plea out to anything,that I did not do.,Brittany's perspective was,,""I'm not gonna plead guilty."",""We're taking,the Stand Your Ground hearing."",I... I enjoy working,with Ron Smith as a private investigator.,And I'm former law enforcement.,I got out of law enforcement,several years ago,because I thought that there was,a need also for cases on the defense side.,There's people that live,in low-income areas.,They don't have,an investigator for their side,,so that's where that need is filled.,Typically in the South,in your Stand Your Ground,,it's a man standin' up and protecting,their life, liberty, property,,all of this that we've always heard.,Men get praised for that.,Where, if a woman does that or a minority,,it's viewed a lot different.,I think, in the South,,a lot of times people don't believe that,there's a problem,with sexual abuse and domestic violence.,Why is it okay,for a woman to sustain injuries,and continue to endure that,before something's done?,I'm for the underdog.,You know, I think I've always been,for the underdog.,We actually got a date,for the Stand Your Ground hearing.,It's, uh, January 14th, 2020.,And we're excited.,Praying, praying that this will be over.,This nightmare will be over.,I'm hoping that this goes through,because it shouldn't just be,a law for men.,Period.,When Brittany testified,,you could a heard a pin drop in that room.,It was just silent.,""Now, Brittany."" ""Yes, sir."",""Todd had come over initially,with permission?"",""Yes, sir."",""When he was attacking you in your house,,did he still have permission to be there?"",""No, sir."",""When attacking your brother,,did he have permission?"",""No, sir."",""Were you afraid he would hurt you?"",""He did hurt me."",The sexual assault nurse examiner,testified to 33 injuries on Brittany.,And the nurse's testimony,was very compelling.,""There were two abrasions,on the left side of the chin,,and they were consistent,with a bite mark."",""There were wounds to the chest,,to the breasts, legs, arms, feet."",And then, ""She had a contusion,that was consistent with a hand print."",And then, ""She had contusions,to the back of the neck."",""I would say my findings,were consistent with a strangulation."",Wow.,I mean, just cried like a baby.,Because that was my baby girl,on that paper.,The nurse also testified,that she could not say with certainty,that Brittany had been sexually assaulted.,But the nurse was clear about that,,that it's not unusual,in sexual assault cases,that you can't say with any certainty,,you know, that someone was raped.,Her story is corroborated,by her injuries.,I don't know what to do. I, like...,- I've been choked almost dead, like...,- Yes.,...raped almost in my bed twice.,So, he did rape you?,No, he did not rape me.,He was trying to.,In the 911 call, Brittany said,that she had not been raped.,Prosecutor Jason Pierce asked Brittany,,""Why would you lie about not being raped?"",Brittany, ""I don't know."",Brittany's lawyers brought in information,that Brittany had been diagnosed,with PTSD,and that something like,,you know, saying in the moment,,""No, I wasn't raped,"",wouldn't be out of the question,for somebody who had been traumatized.,Do you want,to just spill your guts to... to a stranger,and tell 'em, ""Okay, yeah,,I just got sexually assaulted and raped."",A lot of rape victims,don't disclose immediately.,It might be years.,Prosecutor Jason Pierce says,,""It seems like you have selective memory."",I mean, obviously, the... the whole point,of... of the prosecution,was to cast doubt right on her story.,She was obviously being asked,about some really difficult things,,but I would say she was really measured.,The prosecutor asked Brittany,,""You hadn't seen him,with a weapon of any sort that evening?"",Brittany answers, ""His hands."",Mr. Pierce says,,""Okay. And that would be..."",Brittany cuts in,and says, ""And his penis."",""And his mouth."",""I saw several weapons."",Todd Smith had very high levels,of methamphetamine in his system.,Extremely high.,The toxicologist testifies,that 200 would be, like, a common amount,that you would see in a DUI case,where someone is on meth.,If you see a video,,and there's somebody trying,to be restrained by the police,,and there's five officers tasing him,and hitting him with their clubs,,and the guy keeps fighting like Superman,,she said that is similar,to what that level of meth,in your system would produce.,I asked him, ""What's that,make you feel like?"" He said, ""Superman."",Me and Todd, we were real close.,He's like a brother to me.,I remember having our four-wheelers,and motorcycles up the mountain.,There's a little creek there.,We'd always get us a drink of water there,out of the spring.,If you really didn't know Todd,,weren't around him every day,,you wouldn't understand him.,Todd was a totally different person,if it hadn't been for drugs.,This is, like,,a criminal history printout,for Todd Smith.,There are definitely,dozens of arrests here.,Some of these are,domestic violence charges.,There's another assault.,Aggravated assault.,Todd's ex-wife knows,what I went through.,She's lucky to be alive,,and she's a very brave soul.,I was held captive numerous times,by Todd and beaten over the years.,The last story I had,that reminded me so much of Brittany was,I was duct-taped and tied to a chair.,I had been held captive by him for days.,Beaten, raped, sodomized.,Everything Brittany had went through,and... and more.,During,the Stand Your Ground hearing,,like, repeatedly brought up,by her prosecutor, Jason Pierce,,was the question of,,""Is Brittany credible?"",The night that the assault happened,,Brittany initially just reached out,to her mom.,She didn't call the police.,Todd said, ""If you call the police,,I will kill you."",But I had to get some help somehow.,So I said, ""Let's go smoke a cigarette."",I knew I didn't have cigarettes.,I knew I was gonna have to call somebody,'cause I didn't have a car at the time.,That night, when she called me,,he had it on speakerphone.,He could hear what she was sayin'.,'Cause he didn't want her,lettin' anybody know what had happened.,Also, Paige Painter testified,about being at work,,uh, the night,that Brittany came into the store,and told her that she had been assaulted.,Brittany said, ""Give me,a piece of paper and a pen."",And she started writing down,names and phone numbers.,She said, ""If something happens to me,,Todd Smith did it."",And, uh, she said, ""Call... call my mom,and tell her to come get me."",""Can you explain that, please?"",""Somehow, you believed your mother,would be in a better position,to handle violent, angry Todd,than a police officer?"",I really wanted my mom.,Because, in Jackson County, I feel like,the police are always on the man's side,,but, um, I know that my mother,would have got him out of that house.,I've seen police officers show up,in Jackson County,to a domestic violence call,and tell people,,""Look, both of y'all,are gonna go to jail."",""It's not gonna be one of y'all.,Both of you are gonna go."",Instead of actually trying,to figure out what happened.,Around here, usually,,women get the short end of the stick.,My mom,,her and her ex-husband fought constantly,,like, beating each other up.,And my mom would... she would go to jail,every single time.,So I am not shocked at all,that Brittany wanted me to call her mom.,During the trial,,there was a lot of women,that were marching for Brittany.,And there was a lot of stories,that were told that day.,Women are coming out and talking more,about what has happened to them,and how the justice system,has failed them as well.,But, you know, they're willing,to stand up and fight now.,They're... they're ready to see a change.,There's been so many women,reach out to me and share their stories.,People that are minorities,,different races,,different sexualities, religions.,Everybody reaching out to me,,telling me that they've been abused,,and they've went to the police,,but the police wouldn't make an arrest.,And some of them are women in jail,for fighting back.,A lot were from Alabama,,and they've been from North Carolina,,from New York, New Mexico,,from just everywhere.,The Stand Your Ground law is,for white men only, from what I've seen.,It's not for minorities.,It's not for women. It's for white men.,And I don't think that's fair.,They've lit a fire in me.,We're just little nobodies over here.,That's the way we're viewed.,But when you get,a ton of little nobodies together...,especially pissed-off women,,they become somebody big.,We are somebody.,We have a voice. We're fixing to use it.,I want to get my children back.,I want them to know,that Mommy's not a murderer,,that Mommy defended herself,,and that,you should always defend yourself.,I pray. I pray that everything goes okay.,It will.,It will.,A few weeks,after the Stand Your Ground hearing,,Judge Holt issued a 19-page order,denying Stand Your Ground immunity.,And essentially, the judge wrote,that Brittany had not proven,that she was legally justified,in pulling the trigger.,Did Todd attack Brittany Smith?,Well, it... it seems pretty clear,that he did.,The judge probably believed,the attack happened.,Of course, that's not,when Brittany Smith shot Todd.,Was she justified in believing,that Todd was going to kill,or going to seriously injure her brother?,That's the issue,,and I think the judge thought,it was an important factor,when she denied our motion.,Upon consideration,of all the evidence,,the court finds that the defendant,has given inconsistent accounts,""of the events surrounding Todd's death."",For example, Brittany's initial lie,that her brother had been,the one who pulled the trigger,did kind of come back to haunt her.,In the eyes of the judge,,it did harm, like, her credibility.,And so I think it was pretty clear,that the judge,did not believe her testimony.,It's gonna be okay. Okay?,It's gonna be okay.,Most of the reaction,that I recall getting from readers,was just, like,,""I still think she's innocent."",They didn't care what the judge said.,I hate that Todd,had to get shot and killed over it,,but I really do believe,she was defending herself.,Probably feels funny for me saying that,,'cause I'm Todd's cousin, but...,I don't want to see her go to prison.,I really don't.,You say it's okay,for women to defend themselves,,but when they do,,be ready for what society has for you.,It's not the law per se,that needs to change.,It's our perceptions of how,we think women should fit into the mold.,And for them to use aggression,even against an attacker of rape,or anything like that,,it's the way we perceive that.,And when you've got cases,that are involving minorities, women,,let's look at why people are not given,the same consideration.,That's a society problem.,That's a stereotype problem.,My attorneys showed me the last offer,,and I was just like, ""What would you do?"",They said, ""I would take it."",""Because you're not gonna,get away with no time."",Well, I know that I did it for my kids.,They'll feel better,knowing that it's over with.,You know? Like, I made a good decision.,My mom's okay. My brother's...,Everybody's okay.,And my kids are okay.,I'll be okay. I'm just...,Mentally, I'm trying,to just stay sane back here.,She said that she felt, like,,essentially backed into a corner,because, if she went to trial,,the judge who would sentence her,if she was convicted is the judge,who had written a 19-page order,questioning her credibility.,And so, the way she described it to me,was that she took,kind of the lesser of... of the evils,and... and took the... the plea deal.,She would get credit for time,that she had already served in jail,,awaiting her trial.,So it was a six-month sentence,,essentially, for murder.,And then the next 18 months,,she would be on house arrest.,Do you risk it all?,Do you play Russian roulette,with people that you don't even know,to decide your fate?,So I understand,why she took a plea agreement.,I don't know.,I mean, I can't fault her for that.,It's just disheartening.,It'll always be on her record that she has,a felony conviction for murder.,And that'll... that'll always follow her.,It makes no sense to me that,the plea deals that were offered to me,were six months for murder,and, uh, a lot more time for manslaughter.,I do not understand how a murder charge,is less than... than a manslaughter.,It doesn't make sense to me.,They were... The court system here,wanted me to take that murder charge,just to say that I took that charge.,I was so dead set on saying,,""I'm not pleading guilty,to that murder charge."",And I feel like,I let a lot of people down.,And I did let myself down too,,but it's something,that I fought with every day.,Hi, baby.,What are you doing?,- You're so pretty.,- No, I'm not.,How are you doing in there?,It was fun on Halloween.,We dressed up, and, um... Hold on.,- Well, Lynn.,- What?,Lynn was a black-eyed pea.,She colored her eye black...,...and put a ""P"" on her shirt.,Lauren was a ""cereal"" killer.,She had a cereal bag...,...around her neck,,and it said ""killer"" on the inside of it.,I was the Statue of Liberty.,To be stuck in jail,and away from your kids on Halloween...,It was... it was the best Halloween,I could've had in here.,I'm gonna have to go get me,a, um... a DUI or something,or a public intoxication,just so I can see you and give you a hug.,Your time's up, baby.,Ten seconds.,- I love you.,- I love you.,All right.,The Christmas lights make me sad.,You see everybody else.,They're running around here,,talking about what they're gonna buy,their kids for Christmas,,and I'm gonna be worried about,,""Is she gonna even get a dinner,for Christmas or Thanksgiving?"",Brittany didn't deserve what she got.,She's been raped,and beaten by him and almost killed.,And now, she's been raped,and beaten by the system.,If you think,that Todd was a victim,,do you consider what Brittany got justice?,And if you don't think Todd was,,and you think she was the victim,,then I can't imagine,you think that she got justice either.,It's like, no matter,whose side you were on,,I don't know that you really will find,justice in this story.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/State_of_Alabama_vs_Brittany_Smith-22771372

By doing? So can,our tribe survive,Brother,We can find a new piece of land,Then together we can build a new homeland, if it's not enough,,it can,take three generations or even ten generations,to turn the land,into fertile grassland,of our tribe,Brother,You are the king,recognized by our tribe,You'll find a better way,When it comes to the king,Ayimu,I have got approval from the,king of the magic beas-,Brother.

back,All right Let's part here,Ning Wumou, shut up,Sit down,Wuchang's decision makes sense,I have sent a message via carrier pigeon,to the Demon-suppressing Department,But Commander Zhang's troops will arrive here in 30,days at the earliest,During the period if the Sect of Rebirth and the king of,the Barbarian Tribe gather magic beasts,to attack our border None can resist them,Just now,Lieutenant Hua badly injured the,king, though at the cost of her life As we saw,The king hasn't gained full power,from the leader of magic beasts,So I think it is imperative that,we should go behind enemy lines to find out the reason,as soon as possible,Then we spread the information,When our well-prepared,reinforcements arrive,maybe we have a chance,to achieve the final victory,OK,Now that you say,we have a chance then tell me your plan,There are only three of us,How will you deploy,troops and scout?,I give you a chance,to convince me,but if you want me,to dance to her tune,No way,Are they the warriors from the,Demon-suppressing Department,who you said execute the order of heaven,to eliminate demons and promote justice,Finally, I have found you,Where is Lieutenant Hua?,Gu Niantong What did do to me?,My king I just used a blood sacrifice,to help you gain power from,the leader of magic beasts,However, the leader,has a small need,and you have to meet it,What did you give me to drink?,Don't worry,The last thing that would,become scarce on the land is just this,Oh Lieutenant Hua has died,Hey,Tell me what you know,That day, Uncle-Masters and,I gathered around the altar to prevent General Chinu,from a blood sacrifice,We wanted to take the opportunity,to destroy the halidom on the altar but unexpectedly,Master-Uncles failed to,resist the power of evil,I was captured by this girl who rode a wolf,She locked me in a tent hiding me under the bed forcing me to watch her,change her clothes,I did nothing but recited,what my master had told me,Women in the secular,world are all tigers,At that time, I heard a voice from,the outside of the tent, calling General Chinu,Women in the secular,world are all tigers,Hey, buddy, that's,really romantic,Go to the point,Then General Chinu came in,They talked a lot,,blah, blah, blah,Suddenly, General Chinu pounced on the girl and,attempted to bite her,but he failed and ran away,I guessed General Chinu was bewitched by the vicious,power of the blood sacrifice,After all the craps, only the,last words are meaningful,Now the king of the,Barbarian Tribe is under the control of the,witchcraft from the Sect of Rebirth,The power he has gained from,the leader of magic beasts needs to be activated,with human blood,Therefore we need to hurry up Before the king of the Barbarian,Tribe is completely controlled,we should sneak into the city steal the halidom and seal in the leader,of magic beasts again.,This is the key to the,success of the battle,How dare you make a blatant attempt to steal,the halidom of my tribe?,What's your purpose?,Calm down, we are,on the same side,The spear of the late king has two spearheads,One is blunt which symbolizes benevolence,The other is sharp,which stands for killing,14 years ago, The Zhao Dynasty made peace,with the Barbarian Tribe,The then king of your tribe gave,one of the spearheads to Zhao as a symbol of peace,If I guess correct,You are the sister,of General Chinu, daughter of the late king,and leader of the wolf cavalry of the,pro-peace faction in the Barbarian Tribe,Chinu Ayimu,Who is General Xiao to you?,He's my father,My father said,General Xiao was a,respectable hero of Zhao,We have no other choice but to steal the,halidom of your tribe,Now the leader of magic beasts have,been tainted by the blood sacrifice,and General Chinu,,under influence of it,is becoming more and,more bloodthirsty,Getting the halidom is the,only way to save your brother,and also the key,to ending the war,I swear by my life once I manage to seal in,the leader of magic beasts,We, the Demon-suppressing,Department will return the halidom to you,I hope you can help us,infiltrate into the city,When you pass by,,don't miss a good buy,Stop,Fine wine,Now we have entered the city,Then how shall we,look for the halidom?,Though city is not big,looking for the,small halidom in it,is like searching for a,needle in a haystack,There are only two places,to hide the halidom,One is the Sect of Rebirth,,which acts as custodian of it,Let's review the timeline,That day when disciples of,the Vajra Sect were killed we were being raided by the,king of the Barbarian Tribe,If the halidom,remains in the altar probably it is still in the hands,of the Sect of Rebirth,Let go of me. Let go of me,Go. You two follow them Hurry up,The halidom has been tainted,by the blood sacrifices,If there is no continuous,blood supply to feed it,,the leader of magic beasts,may get furious at any time,It's your great honor to worship the leader of magic,beasts with your blood,Blood gathering,places in the city must be the branches,of the Sect of Rebirth,The second place to hide the halidom is one,heavily guarded by soldiers of the Barbarian Tribe,As Princess Chinu said the halidom was once stolen,and now it is back so the king must keep,it under heavy guard,For Princess Chinu it's not difficult,By order of General to approach the halidom - No one is allowed to,approach the camp,I need to talk to my brother,General Chinu is not in the camp,Princess, please go back,Third - Third?,Did you say there are,only two places?,Whenever a magic spell is,performed, traces will be left,I'm afraid the Sect of Rebirth may,preset a countermove in the halidom,If so even if we get the halidom we can't seal in the evil,Therefore, we must explore,the underground altar again,One of you is proficient,in Yuxu theurgy,and the other is a disciple,from the Vajra Sect,Go find what witchcraft the,Sect of Rebirth is using,and formulate a countermeasure in case of need,If you can't find the,way, just ask someone,I just happen to know,the best source of information,After we enter the city tomorrow try to complete our task within eight hours,Then let's meet in the,west of the city,I'll arrange the evacuation route,Thank you, Princess,Don't forget our agreement,Come, come here,Come on, little monk,We are already here Come on,It's OK,Go up, go up,Go up - No no no,Sit down,Server up all the,best food and wine you can offer,Women in the secular world are all tigers.,Women in the secular world are all tigers,Women in the secular,world are all tigers,I have sinned. I have sinned.,What's this?,Wine,When they start,carrying blood plasma,we'll find out,a den of the Sect of Rebirth,What's this?,An exotic snack,Glutinous rice cake,with red dates,It can enrich your blood,Have some more drinks,Little monk, I didn't see your,true colors until just now,Little taoist,I have found that,your team,is not in harmony,Well,Yesterday you said you wanted,to save Ayimu's brother,Is it a makeshift?,No,Hua Wuchang, let's,talk about her first,is always,overweening,She has a sharp tongue,like a dog with a bone,whenever she finds one's fault,She must have offended a,lot of people all the way,Do you not want to avenge,Lieutenant Hua's death?,So many soldiers of the Demon-suppressing Department,have been killed. Do you want to let it go?,I really don't understand,why Lieutenant Hua ordered,me to protect you,when she was dying,Your big brother,either doesn't talk,or when he does,he gives a self-righteous speech,Now the Zhao Dynasty is at,war with the Barbarian Tribe,if we focus on personal enmity,when can the war be ended?,Where are you going?,I'm going to scout the,south of the city,You stay here to keep,an eye on the enemy,Execute the order of heaven to,eliminate demons and promote justice,What a snappy slogan,but your teammates go it alone,so rudderless,that you are exposed,to danger, helpless,I feel so sorry,for you,Gu Niantong, the No.2 minister,of the Sect of Rebirth,Who's lurking around there?,I guess,they are probably quarreling now,but your big brother,doesn't bother to explain.,He keeps a straight face all day,Everyone can tell he has,something on his mind?,What is it?,What is it?,Tell us,What can he worry about?,Nothing but all the past,history of his father,hovering around his mind,such as the fall,of the Xiao family,the son of a sinner,Nobody wants to talk to him in,the Demon-suppressing Department,Come on. Come on,Have a drink. Have a drink,You lurked outside the camp,You want to attack my brother,by surprise, don't you?,He deserves to die,If the king is killed,his army will naturally collapse,On one side, a monk and a taoist,are binging on meat and wine,immersed in sensual pleasures,On the other side, Hua Wuchang,ignores the military order,just for personal enmity,The elaborate plan you worked,out after a sleepless night,have been scrapped by them,I wonder why your Xiao family,is always framed,by your own people,What do you mean,by ''always framed by,your own people''?,14 years ago,The Barbarian Tribe started,a war with the Zhao Dynasty,General Xiao couldn't bear,to see the brutal killings,countless corpses,so he took it upon himself,to negotiate peace with the,king of the Barbarian Tribe,Then the tribe left and settled,down in a place far away from Zhao,Both sides didn't confront,each other anymore,But just on the day General,Xiao returned to the court,the Hua family and the Wu family,sent a joint letter to the emperor,accusing General Xiao,of ignoring his order,shrinking from war and retreating,without authorization.,At last, General Xiao,was beheaded at the,south gate of the city,Dad,Dad,Witch,how dare you tease me with magic,Just a little magic,Why can't you solve it?,Oh, I almost forgot the reason,You have been studying hard,for more than ten years,but you haven't got,any magic power,Do you know why?,Witch, don't disturb my mind,Shut up,Your master Lu Guanlan,teaches you how to develop,the demon-breaking knack,because he wants you to unknowingly,destroy your foundation of magic,and just become a container,that the Demon-suppressing Department,uses to entrap magic beasts,This man,follows Commander Lu to practice,the demon-breaking knack,though without magic power,he can serve as,a container to seal,in magic beasts,Does he know this?,No,It's extremely dangerous,to seal magic beasts,in a human body,It's the last resort,Don't use it unless,there is no other way,Seal magic beasts,in a human body,It's simply a joke,Prior to you,eight people had made an attempt,,but most of them were killed,Why do you,tell me these?,The Demon-suppressing,Department wants you to die,but I can help you live,Having said that,Xiao, though dull and inflexible,is the only straightforward,true man,in the Demon-suppressing,Department,I take him as my lifelong friend,Little monk,Say something you know about me,You,You are among the least?

Perfect.,Kill two birds with one stone,Wait,This is not the way of sealing,We didn't go to the altar,Besides, the magic,tools for sealing,were left,in the brothel,So, a moment later,whatever jumps out,of the halidom,let's cripple it first,with the battle array,And little monk,uses his Buddhist Vajra Seal,to temporarily suppress it,Then we bring it back to the Demon-suppressing,Department by horse as fast as possible,There we can ask kungfu,masters to reinforce the seal,Bad idea.

you sure you're okay?,It's okay.,Brother.,You're bleeding.,Mr. Bao,Yesterday's beast murder case,,the victims were all from Tianji Cabinet.,As far as I could see,,the dead body was covered with scratches,,as if they had been,wounded by wild animals.,But upon my closer examination,,I found that the wounds were very flat,,as if they were caused,by a sharp instrument.,The killers of the Tianji,Cabinet murders are all here.,They were obviously human,,so why did we see,wolves that day?,I took a little black powder,from you that day.,It was stolen.,That doesn't even matter.,My second brother has investigated,the source of that black powder.,It's the snake venom of the,Nine-Quartered King Snake.,It's not fatal, but it can,cause hallucinations.,Hallucinations?,So that's it.,That's the secret they're trying to hide.,This tattoo and everything in the chamber,proves that,they are the Skywolf clan.,That Lu Youxin,is also a member of the Skywolf clan.,Mr. Bao.,The murderer of the Tianji,Cabinet case has been found out,,and it is the Skywolf Clan.,Guard Zhan.,What did you say?,He said that the killer was the Skywolves.,Wolves and pigs?,How do you run the case?,So absurd.,What face do I have to explain,to the emperor and the people?,My Lord.,Not wolves and pigs.,It's the Skywolves.,It's the Skywolf Clan.,Zhanzhao, come up, come up and say.,Yes.,Mr. Bao,Ever since the court,sent troops to purge the,Skywolf clan for rebellion,,they have been in hiding for many years.,This time they have,reappeared in the capital,,they must have a plan.,Then, according to Guard Zhan, it means...,They've come back,to take revenge on the court.,Zhanzhao.,What do you think?,If,Their goal is the imperial court,,why do they want to,bloodbath the Tianji Cabinet?,I've checked it out.,The steel claws on this wolf man's hands,exactly match the wounds on the victim,at the crime scene in Tianji Cabinet.,And,Lu Youxin's seal,was also at the Tianji Cabinet crime scene.,It means that Lu Youxin,must have something to do with this case.,When we investigated Lu Youxin's house,,he had already been silenced.,This means that someone was behind this,and prevented us from investigating.,And,is there anyone to suspect?,Xiao Li.,Who?,Xiao Li.,Daring.,Xiao Li was an official of the court,and always did his duty.,Suspect him?,Do you have proof?,There is no conclusive evidence yet.,But according to my speculation,,they know that the seal,fell into the hands of us,,and sooner or later they,will investigate Lu Youxin,,so they will definitely,kill to silence him.,And that day at the Ding House,,it was Xiao Li who took Lu Youxin's seal,and gave it to me.,The contents of the seal,were seen only by him.,From the time he got the seal to,the time we investigated Lu's house,,he had all this time,to tip off and kill people.,The most important thing is that dead.,When Xiao Li arrived at Lu's house,,he even did not look at the,deceased clearly in that case,,and said out of the blue:,Lu Youxin is dead，,Lu Youxin is dead.,It is clear that,he already knew that the,deceased is Lu Youxin.,This case is very involved,and not trivial.,Since there are clues, Zhanzhao,,this case will be fully handed,over to you to investigate.,Remember,,nothing can go wrong.,Yes.,Brother Zhanzhao.,Are you scared silly?,How can you doubt my brother?,Who saved us that,day at the risk of his life?,Miss Ding.,Xiao Li's kung fu is beneath,both me and the white mouse.,In the white mist,,why did we all suffer repeated attacks?,And yet he was able to come,to our rescue many times.,He was trying to get at us.,What caused me the most suspicion was that,the wound on his body,was not scratched by a wolf's claw,,but by a sword wound.,It was my sword.,Then you can't assume that,my brother is one of the wolves,just because he received a sword wound.,Miss Ding is right.,You can't just guess like that,and say that Miss Ding's brother,,is the murderer.,The case should be,investigated with evidence.,The case is the process,of pulling out the threads,and stringing together the clues.,Speculation,is just a way to get to the truth faster.,Miss Ding.,If you believe me,,do not let Xiao Li get suspicious.,If he is innocent,,I will certainly give him justice.,Miss Ding, I'm on your side.,You'll be my witness when the time comes.,When I find out the real,murderer in this case,,the name of the imperial cat,Zhanzhao will be changed to stupid cat,,unable to distinguish,between right and wrong.,Guard Zhan.,Guard Zhan.,Mr. Xiao is awake.,My brother is awake.,My brother.,Mr. Xiao.,You're here.,Brother.,Are you okay with your injuries?,Not a problem.,It's just a little scary,now that I think about it.,I've never seen anything so strange.,It was white smoke and mist,,and what I clearly saw,,was a werewolf coming at me.,But why,,I received a sword wound?,Who knows which one of you,stabbed the wrong person?,Mr. Xiao,,That day, there was a lot of fog,,I did not distinguish,between friend and foe,,and hurt Lord Xiao by,mistake, I am really sorry.,Who can see clearly,at a critical moment?,Mr. Zhan, you don't have to blame yourself.,It's okay，brother, you take,care of your injuries first.,I'll get you the best doctor in town.,Forget it.,I've sort of come back from the dead,and picked up a life.,But Mr. Xiao,,that blood wolf thing,now I have a clue.,When I was,in Lu Youxin's secret room,,I found that,there seemed to be something,else at the end of that room,,so,I was going to take,someone to check it out.,Mr. Zhan, are you still going,to that dangerous place?,The end of the chamber,must be related to the Blood Wolf case.,If I don't step up my investigation,,the culprit will learn about it,and I'm afraid they'll,go to destroy the clues.,In that case, then,,Mr. Zhan,,you should go and investigate the clues,so that they are not lost.,Then you rest in peace.,Brother, you take care of your injuries.,Brother.,Brother.,Didn't you say you were going to,the secret room of the Lu House?,You'll believe whatever,the stupid cat says.,So, why don't you believe him,when he says he doesn't love you?,It's impossible to believe this one.,You don't talk nonsense.,You guys stop arguing.,I deliberately mentioned the,secret room of the Lu House,to see his reaction.,The human expression,does not deceive itself.,But,I had a vague feeling,that he was a little weird.,Are you still suspicious of my brother?,He was wounded in the chamber,,and it makes sense that,he would have palpitations,at the mention of the chamber.,But you should know that,being afraid and being,nervous are two different things.,Xiao Li was also in,charge of the city defense,,which was his job.,But I got the feeling that,he didn't seem to want,me to keep looking into it.,White rat.,Didn't you always want,to compare yourself to me?,Say two words.,I'll tell you what.,Do you remember,what we saw in the autopsy room?,Are you talking about the tattoos,on the arms of those werewolves?,What are you talking about?,Every one of the Skywolf clan,has a tattoo on his arm.,If Xiao Li also has this tattoo on his arm,,then it would confirm that,my
